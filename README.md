### :wave: T'sup Everybody

I'm a 3rd-year Electronic Engineering student with a thing for CAD Designing, 3D Animation & Automation (Scripting), not to mention a never-ending enthusiasm for Graphic Designing & â„­alligraphy.

I started programming back in 2016 using **Visual Basic** and had some games created with it, but I can now use anything from **Assembly** to **C++** & **C#** for my work projects, as well as **Shell** & **AHK** for my personal projects.

PS I've also learnt **HTML**, but I was talking about **"Programming Languages"** above so I didn't mention it ðŸ™ƒ
